# Assignment

**Full details of the assignment will be added later**

## Overview

This is a group project to be completed in groups of ~5 students. You should
work together on a single codebase but each of you should contribute some
individual parts of the code.

You will produce a joint submission as a group in a single GitHub repo and an
individual report to be submitted to Blackboard:

* Code (on GitHub)
* Project Report (on GitHub)
* Reflection Report (submitted individually on Blackboard)

The project is open-ended with the exact goal to be decided amongst your group
but the theme is around simulations and data relating to the coronavirus
epidemic. You should make a program or several programs that can either run
simulations or produce plots based on real data.

You should collaborate and share your code using a **private** repository on
GitHub. The repository should be shared with your TA: the code that is present
on GitHub at the time of the deadline will be treated as being your
submission for this project.

Along with your code there should be a group Project Report explaining your
code and what it does and including some figures that are output from your
code or perhaps links to videos or any other output.

Each of you should write a short individual Reflection Report which explains
your own contributions to the project and reflects on how you and the rest of
the team worked collaborated together. This is to be submitted through
Blackboard.

**Note**: While this is mainly about code contributions individual marks will
be based on the Reflection Report in Blackboard. If you do not submit the
Reflection Report you will get a mark of zero for the whole project. If you
submit it late then lateness penalties will apply to the mark for the whole
project.
