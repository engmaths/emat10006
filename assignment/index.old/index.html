You should work together on a single codebase but each of you should contribute some individual parts of the code.</p> <p>You will produce a joint submission as a group in a single GitHub repo and an individual report to be submitted to Blackboard:</p> <ul> <li><p>Code &#40;on GitHub&#41;</p> <li><p>Project Report &#40;on GitHub&#41;</p> <li><p>Reflection Report &#40;submitted individually on Blackboard&#41;</p> </ul> <p>The project is open-ended with the exact goal to be decided amongst your group but the theme is around simulations and data relating to the coronavirus epidemic. You should make a program or several programs that can either run simulations or produce plots based on real data.</p> <p>You should collaborate and share your code using a <strong>private</strong> repository on GitHub. The repository should be shared with your TA: the code that is present on GitHub at the time of the deadline will be treated as being your submission for this project.</p> <p>Along with your code there should be a group Project Report explaining your code and what it does and including some figures that are output from your code or perhaps links to videos or any other output.</p> <p>Each of you should write a short individual Reflection Report which explains your own contributions to the project and reflects on how you and the rest of the team worked collaborated together. This is to be submitted through Blackboard.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: While this is mainly about code contributions indivdual marks will be based on the Reflection Report in Blackboard. If you do not submit the Reflection Report you will get a mark of zero for the whole project. If you submit it late then lateness penalties will apply to the mark for the whole project.</p> <h2 id=example ><a href="#example" class=header-anchor >Example</a></h2> <p>An example of a program that runs some simulations can be found <a href=simulator.py >here</a>. For examples of usage look inside the code which has explanations in the docstrings and comments. This was also discussed in the live session &#40;see the recording on Blackboard&#41;.</p> <p>If you run the script you should see something like this:</p> <iframe width=560  height=315  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBtmIR50w7Q" frameborder=0  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <p>Some key points to note about this example code:</p> <ul> <li><p>It is possible to run simulations with different parameters by running with different command line arguments or by calling the functions with different arguments &#40;it is not necessary to edit the code to run with different parameters&#41;.</p> <li><p>The same simulation code can be used to produce different kinds of outputs e.g. on screen animation, plot in a file.</p> <li><p>The same animation and plotting code could also be used with different kinds of simulation &#40;e.g. if an alternative version of the Simulation class was made&#41;.</p> <li><p>The interface and relationships between the classes has been <em>designed</em> &#40;e.g. which methods should be called by which other classes&#41;.</p> <li><p>Docstrings give examples of how to use the different functions and classes along with explanations of details that are important in understanding what the code does.</p> <li><p>Comments are used to clarify the other overall structure of the code, or to explain things that are <em>not obvious</em> from the code itself but that will help someone looking at that particular bit of code.</p> </ul> <h2 id=code ><a href="#code" class=header-anchor >Code</a></h2> <p>The example code linked above is intended to illustrate several points but actually you should submit a repository with multiple files in it. For example here the animation classes could be moved into a file called <code>animation.py</code>. The <code>Simulation</code> class could be moved into a file called <code>simulation.py</code>. Then the <code>main</code> function could go into a file called <code>runsim.py</code>.</p> <p>At that point you would have a more scalable organisation of code: more types of simulation could be added in <code>simulation.py</code>. More ways to animate could be added in <code>animation.py</code>. There could be more top-level scripts like <code>runsim_model2.py</code> to run different kinds of animation/simulation. These scripts could do different things and make different plots but reusing the <em>same</em> code from <code>animation.py</code> and <code>simulation.py</code>.</p> <p>You should make good use of functions and classes in your project. It is not strictly necessary to use classes although it might be the best way to organise some parts of your code. The important point is to have good clean code:</p> <ul> <li><p>No global variables &#40;although global constants are allowed&#41;</p> <li><p>Design a collection of functions/classes that work together in a coherent way. Give those functions and classes good clear names.</p> <li><p>Make different parts of your code reusable even if you do not actually use them more than once in the project.</p> <li><p>Make your code understandable - someone who has not seen the code before should be able to look at the docstrings and the function names and understand what they do.</p> <li><p>They should also be able to look at the docstring at the top of each module and understand what the whole module is for. The README file should explain what the whole repo does.</p> </ul> <p>Before you write any code come up with an overall <em>design</em> of the codebase:</p> <ul> <li><p>What things will it be possible to do with the code and how?</p> <li><p>What functions or classes will you make in order to achieve this?</p> <li><p>How will those functions or classes be used?</p> <li><p>Can you give those functions and classes a consistent naming scheme that emphasises their simularities, differences and relationships?</p> <li><p>What files will you have to organise the code?</p> <li><p>Which parts of the code depend on which other parts?</p> </ul> <p>Your repository should also have a <code>README.md</code> file which you can use to explain from a high-level how to run the programs from the repository after cloning it. An <code>md</code> file can be plain text or it can be formatted using markdown: <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/</a></p> <p>If you have data in your project then &#40;unless the data files are large&#41; it should be inluded in the repository in a text-based format such as a <code>.csv</code> file. It is important to note that you should not generally store binary files such as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets in a GitHub repo as it can only store textual data efficiently. Also if you commit large files then GitHub will not allow you to push them.</p> <h2 id=project_report ><a href="#project_report" class=header-anchor >Project Report</a></h2> <p>Your Project Report can be in any format e.g. Word, LaTeX, Markdown, Jupyter Notebook and should be stored in your GitHub repo. Note though that a binary Word file can not be efficiently stored in git so if you want to add your report as a Word document then just add it once at the very end of your project &#40;when you will not need to make any further changes&#41;.</p> <p>The report should not be long. The purpose of the report is to succinctly explain any models you are using or data that you have obtained and to show the resulting plots that you have made. This project is about code &#40;rather than modelling, data analysis, or epidemiology&#41; so the report should be about showcasing some outputs of your code and explaining how your code can be used to produce those as well as other outputs. A minimum of explanation is needed for those outputs to be understandable but you do <strong>not</strong> need to have a &quot;background&quot; section or a &quot;literature review&quot; or anything like that - It would be reasonable to include links to any references though e.g. if your models are inspired by something else.</p> <p>You should make your plots look really good with good labels, legends and captions. Think carefully about the colours you use, the thickness of lines, the size of text. A lot goes into the design of a good plot:</p> <ul> <li><p>What about using subplots to have many plots in one figure?</p> <li><p>Is there a way that you can combine multiple plots to make a single plot that conveys the same information more compactly?</p> <li><p>Should your plots be on linear or logarithmic &#40;or semilog&#41; scales?</p> <li><p>Does it make sense to use a line or markers or perhaps a barchart?</p> <li><p>Should your plot have error bars?</p> <li><p>Can you annotate key information on the plot?</p> </ul> <p>Think of this report as being like an essay where almost all of the marks are for how good your figures &#40;or linked videos etc&#41; are.</p> <h1 id=reflective_report ><a href="#reflective_report" class=header-anchor >Reflective Report</a></h1> <p>The template for the individual reflective report can be found <a href=reflection_report_template.docx >here</a></p> <p>Each of you should submit an individual reflective report explaining your own contributions and how you and your team have collaborated. This information along with your TA&#39;s record of contributions and attendance will be used in giving each student an individual mark for the project.</p> <h1 id=collaboration ><a href="#collaboration" class=header-anchor >Collaboration</a></h1> <p>You should plan how you and your team are going to collaborate on the same codebase. There should be a plan for who is going to produce which parts of the code and how those parts are going to work together e.g.:</p> <ul> <li><p>Who is going to write each part of the code?</p> <li><p>Which parts of the code use which other parts?</p> <li><p>How will you try to avoid merge conflicts?</p> <li><p>How will each of you test that your changes are not causing someone else&#39;s code to stop working? &#40;This should be checked before each <code>git push</code>&#41;</p> </ul> <p>If each of you writes separate code and happens to store that code in the same repo in different files with no relation between them then that is a simple strategy for avoiding conflicts. However that is not really <em>collaborating</em> on the same code. You should be writing code &#40;e.g. functions and classes&#41; for others to use and using code that others have written. How well you have successfully managed to work as a team will be assessed as part of this.</p> <p>As well as looking at how well you have collaborated we will also look at what your individual contributions are. Sometimes it is good to work in pairs on a particular part of the code where one of you writes the code and the other watches and makes suggestions &#40;this is &quot;pair coding&quot;&#41;. That is good practice and if you do that then you should both record that in your Reflection Reports. However there must be commits from each member of the team: it is possible to tell from git who has committed what changes to the code. If there is no evidence of contributions in the commits then you can not be given credit for your contributions. If you are going to practice pair coding then it needs to be done both ways around so that you take in turns to do the writing and committing.</p> <h1 id=rough_markscheme ><a href="#rough_markscheme" class=header-anchor >Rough markscheme</a></h1> <p>Marking will first consider a mark for the project as a whole. You will be asked whether you are happy to share the same mark among all members of the group and if everyone agrees then you will all get the same mark for the project. Otherwise each individual student will get a different mark based on our assessment of individual contribution. For this we will look at our own records of engagement and contribution in the group meetings, the commits recorded in git and what everyone has written in their Reflection Reports.</p> <p>The main things that we want to see are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Collaboration</p> <li><p>Readable, documented code</p> <li><p>Designed and reusable code</p> <li><p>Quality outputs &#40;e.g. nice plots, although it doesn&#39;t have to be plots&#41;</p> <li><p>A report that explains these things</p> </ul> <p>A basic project would be something like:</p> <ul> <li><p>Each member of the group has made a script that does some simulation or uses some data.</p> <li><p>Each script makes a reasonable plot &#40;with labels etc&#41;.</p> <li><p>The report explains what has been done and shows the plots.</p> <li><p>The code is well organised and neatly written.</p> <li><p>Everyone has made reasonable commits to the repository.</p> <li><p>The README explains &#40;correctly&#41; how to use the code.</p> </ul> <p>A good project would be something like:</p> <ul> <li><p>The code is well organised into files with reusable functions and maybe classes</p> <li><p>Different simulations or plots etc are using shared reusable code</p> <li><p>Different members of the group are working on the same parts of the code and/or reusing the functions/classes that other members have made.</p> <li><p>There is a high-level organisation in the files of the codebase</p> <li><p>There is design in how a collection of functions/classes have been put together.</p> <li><p>The code is documented in a consistent and clear way and is understandable to someone else navigating the repository for the first time.</p> <li><p>The code can be used to generate many different outputs e.g. by using command line arguments.</p> <li><p>The different outputs from the project make sense as part of a coherent whole &#40;e.g. to evaluate some hypothesis or answer some general question&#41;</p> <li><p>The report explains how the different parts of the project can be combined coherently to draw meaningful conclusions &#40;e.g. comparison of model and data&#41;</p> <li><p>The plots or other outputs are carefully designed to look good and convey lots of information and have good captions.</p> </ul> <p>There are many things that might make sense for some projects but not others such as using testing or exceptions, classes, packages etc. It is up to you whether to include these if it makes sense to include them. Note that there are no tests in the provided example code because it&#39;s hard to test animation code and the simulations are non-deterministic which is also hard to test.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks we will mention other things that you may or may not want to include in your projects. Making use of any features or extras that make sense for your project is good practice and will be noted when marking but there are no hard rules about what you must use.</p> <h2 id=ideas ><a href="#ideas" class=header-anchor >Ideas</a></h2> <p>There are lots of different ways of modelling epidemics:</p> <ul> <li><p>Agent-based modelling &#40;e.g. simulating interacting people&#41;. The simulator script I&#39;ve given does that but with the people on a grid. You can also do it with the people moving around and infecting each other or with a more complicated connectivity than a grid.</p> <li><p>You can also not model individual people but instead the total number of infected people e.g. there are 10000 people and 100 are infected. The next day there will be approximately 120 infected people &#40;using random numbers somehow&#41;.</p> <li><p>You can also use continuous numbers with differential equations &#40;e.g. SIR model&#41;.</p> </ul> <p>You can find discussion and examples here: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/covid19-top-7-online-interactive-simulations-curated-fa4282889875">https://towardsdatascience.com/covid19-top-7-online-interactive-simulations-curated-fa4282889875</a></p> <p>There are many different things that you could consider in a model such as:</p> <ul> <li><p>Vaccinated people</p> <li><p>Partial immunity</p> <li><p>Numbers of people in hospital</p> </ul> <p>There&#39;s also loads of data for different countries, different regions etc. The UK government gives daily totals for the whole of the UK for both positive tests and deaths. Those are also broken down by local authority &#40;e.g. Bristol, North Somerset etc&#41;. You can even get weekly data for areas of Bristol &#40;St Pauls, Clifton, ...&#41;.</p> <p>I think it would be really interesting to focus on a local epidemic in Bristol and look at the different areas over time. The outbreak has been very different in student areas for example: Stoke Bishop and City Centre had pretty much the highest rates in the country in late October but are now down to almost zero &#40;have the halls reached herd immunity?&#41;. You could also compare Bristol with say Manchester or some other city or the UK with another country.</p> <p>There are many places to get this data but UK government data available here &#40;note that you can download the data in e.g. a spreadsheet&#41;.</p> <p><a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/interactive-map">https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/interactive-map</a></p> <p>There are lots of places to read about covid data presentation. You can find some discussion and examples here:</p> <p><a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Covid-19-and-the-art-and-science-of-data-visualisation">https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Covid-19-and-the-art-and-science-of-data-visualisation</a></p> <p>Comparison of simulations with data are also interesting. Perhaps some members of the group could make simulations and others could collect data and you could devise some way of comparing them to evaluate different models and/or make predictions for the future. There are lots of questions that you could think about using either data or modelling or both like how to ease restrictions while carrying out a vaccination program, best strategies for lockdowns and so on.</p> <p>These ideas are deliberately vague. If you have an idea for something quite different then I&#39;m happy to discuss whether that would make a reasonable project - please begin by discussing with your TA.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Oscar Benjamin.
