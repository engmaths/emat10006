You should work together on a single codebase but each of you should contribute some individual parts of the code.</p> <p>You will produce a joint submission as a group in a single GitHub repo and an individual report to be submitted to Blackboard:</p> <ul> <li><p>Code &#40;on GitHub&#41;</p> <li><p>Project Report &#40;on GitHub&#41;</p> <li><p>Reflection Report &#40;submitted individually on Blackboard&#41;</p> </ul> <p>The project is open-ended with the exact goal to be decided amongst your group but the theme is around simulations and data relating to the coronavirus epidemic. You should make a program or several programs that can either run simulations or produce plots based on real data.</p> <p>You should collaborate and share your code using a <strong>private</strong> repository on GitHub. The repository should be shared with your TA: the code that is present on GitHub at the time of the deadline will be treated as being your submission for this project.</p> <p>Along with your code there should be a group Project Report explaining your code and what it does and including some figures that are output from your code or perhaps links to videos or any other output.</p> <p>Each of you should write a short individual Reflection Report which explains your own contributions to the project and reflects on how you and the rest of the team worked collaborated together. This is to be submitted through Blackboard.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: While this is mainly about code contributions individual marks will be based on the Reflection Report in Blackboard. If you do not submit the Reflection Report you will get a mark of zero for the whole project. If you submit it late then lateness penalties will apply to the mark for the whole project.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Oscar Benjamin. Last modified: February 15, 2022.
