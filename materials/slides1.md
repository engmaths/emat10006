# Outline

## The idea

* Build on the intro unit
* Reinforce basic programming
* Think about larger codebases
* Work collaboratively
* Use version control (git/github)

## Weekly Schedule

* Videos and other materials
* 1hr live session
* Dropin session
* 2hr lab

## Why Python?

* High level language
* Intends not to be hard to learn
* Suitable for scientific/engineering work
* Used heavily in data science etc
* Right tool for the job in student projects

## How Python?

* Created by Guido van Rossum (BDFL) in the early 90s
* Derived from the C family
* Entirely open source from the outset
* Very popular after 30 years
* See [discussions](https://discuss.python.org/)
* Named after [Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo)

## Year reps?

## Terminal

Quick demo...

Understand the `$` convention for input/output. This you should type in the
terminal:
```console
$ ls
myscript.py
$ python myscript.py
stuff
```

These are Python commands (note `>>>`) and you should type them into *python*:
```python
>>> x = 1 + 1
>>> x
2
```

## Terminal

* CLI: Command Line Interface
* GUI: Graphical User Interface

Learning terminal and CLI is *not* optional here!

## Command line

* Lower level way of interacting with computers
* More efficient
* Reproducible
* Composable
* Automatable

## Terminal

Longer demo...

## Build Python

```console
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/Python-3.8.1.tgz
$ tar -xzf Python-3.8.1.tgz
$ cd Python-3.8.1
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

## Github

We'll talk about this more later but here's CPython:

## That's all

Make sure to meet your TA on Friday!
