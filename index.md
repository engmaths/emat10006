# Overview

## Purpose of the unit

This unit is EMAT10006 - Further Computer Programming. It is intended to
follow on from EMAT10007 - Introduction to Computer Programming.

The intro unit introduces programming with Python and is intended for students
with no prior background in programming. The Further Computer Programming
(FCP) unit is intended to focus more on supporting skills for programming such
as:

* Using the terminal
* Using version control with git
* Working collaboratively on a single codebase
* Working with larger codebases
* Principles of software engineering
* Using some common Python libraries

The idea is to build on knowing the basics of programming itself and to gain a
greater understanding of how programming is used professionally and some
commonly needed skills.

## Weekly Schedule - First half of the unit

* Materials made available on the website/Blackboard
* Worksheet about the topic to do in the lab
* 2hr lab on Mondays (1300-1500 or 1500-1700 in MVB 2.11 - also on Remo)
* Dropin session (Friday 1300 MVB 2.11 - also on Remo)

Each week in the lab the topic and materials for the week will be introduced
and there will be time to go through the worksheet and get help from TAs. The
worksheet might take longer than the lab and can be finished in your own time.
The dropin session is another chance to get one to one help.

## Weekly Schedule - Second half of the unit

Some details TBC

In the second half of the unit you will work on group projects.

## Assessment

The assessment will be a group project working on simulations, data analysis
and plotting.

* Single coursework
* Deadline Friday week 23
* Group coursework (groups of 4-5)
* Different tasks within a shared codebase (using github)
* Group report in the repo
* Individual short report
* More details later
