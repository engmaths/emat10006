# Overview

## Purpose of the unit

This unit is EMAT10006 - Further Computer Programming. It is intended to
follow on from EMAT10007 - Introduction to Computer Programming.

The intro unit introduces programming with Python and is intended for students
with no prior background in programming. The Further Computer Programming
(FCP) unit is intended to focus more on supporting skills for programming such
as:

* Using the terminal
* Using version control with git
* Working collaboratively on a single codebase
* Working with larger codebases
* Principles of software engineering

The idea is to build on knowing the basics of programming itself and to gain a
greater understanding of how programming is used professionally.

## Weekly Schedule - First half of the unit

* Videos and other materials for the topic
* 1hr live session (Wednesday 1300-1400 on Blackboard Collaborate)
* Dropin session (Thursday 1700-1800 on Remo)
* 1hr meeting with tutor TA (Friday 1000-1100 or 1200-1300 on Teams)
* Worksheet about the topic

Each week in the live session the topic and materials for the week will be
introduced and there will be time for questions and answers.

The dropin session is a chance to get one to one help with a TA. This is
particularly useful if you want to spend some time discussing a subject in
depth or for getting help with specific problems that you have on your own
computer.

The tutor meeting is a chance to talk through the topic and the material from
the worksheet *before* you begin working on it. You should then complete the
worksheet over the *following* week.

## Weekly Schedule - Second half of the unit

Some details TBC

and plotting.

* Single coursework
