There are many resources already available for you to learn about this. Here I will just explain the basic terminology. You have probably heard people talk about git/github/bitbucket etc. before without knowing what they were talking about. There are a few related concepts here and it&#39;s easy to get them mixed up.</p> <p>Firstly <code>git</code> is a couple of programs used for <em>version control</em>. Version control is a way of systematically keeping track of your code making it easy to:</p> <ol> <li><p>Store multiple versions of your code</p> <li><p>Undo changes to your code</p> <li><p>Use &#40;and edit&#41; the same code in different places</p> <li><p>Collaborate with other people using the same code</p> </ol> <p>There are many different version control systems and as far as I can tell <code>git</code> is the most popular for programmers. I personally use it for almost all of my work. Specifically <code>git</code> is a command line program that you run from the terminal. There are graphical <code>git</code> programs but I recommend learning at least the basics of the command line version first since this is what is most often used.</p> <p>You can use <code>git</code> to keep track of the files on your computer. However it is more often used to keep track of files across many computers &#40;and between different people&#41;. For this you will usually want to have a git <code>server</code>. When you have access to a git server it is possible to <code>push</code> and <code>pull</code> your code to and from the server. This enables you to store your code in one central place but also use it in many other places.</p> <p>There are <em>git hosting</em> companies, for example <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">bitbucket</a>, that provide free git servers that you can use if you open an account. These not only provide git servers but also a web interface for viewing your code and convenient ways to collaborate your code with other people &#40;such as discussion pages, pull requests, etc&#41;.</p> <p>The python interpreter that we have been using is called CPython. CPython is developed using GitHub. You can see the GitHub page and view the code for the interpreter <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">here</a>. Hopefully that gives you an idea of what git/GitHub can do for a large code project. Of course we will usually work on smaller projects but that doesn&#39;t stop git being useful.</p> <p>Now that I&#39;ve explained briefly explained what git is I want you to work your way through the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud">atlassian tutorial</a>. For now I want you to understand everything in this tutorial except the part about branches towards the end &#40;feel free to read that but we don&#39;t need it yet&#41;.</p> <p>I will link to some additional resources but please understand that <code>git</code> is more advanced than we really need. It is designed for professional programmers and has many more commands and functionality than any of you will <em>ever</em> want to use. I personally only know a small subset of its commands and that&#39;s still plenty enough to be very useful.</p> <p>A good place to look for resources on git is the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials">bitbucket tutorial list</a>. There is also the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual.html">official git docs</a> which give a more complete description of the things that git can do - you do not need to read all of that though&#33;</p> <h2 id=exercises ><a href="#exercises" class=header-anchor >Exercises</a></h2> <ol> <li><p>Create a local git repository &#40;create a folder, <code>cd</code> in and run <code>git init</code>&#41;.</p> <li><p>Create a Python file in that folder and put some code in it. &#40;What does <code>git status</code> show you now?&#41;</p> <li><p>Add the file with <code>git add</code>. What does <code>git status</code> show now?</p> <li><p>Commit the file and add a commit message e.g. <code>git commit -m &#39;Adding some code...&#39;</code></p> <li><p>Make changes to the file and run <code>git status</code> again. Now try <code>git diff</code> - can you understand the output?</p> <li><p>Repeat these steps a few times until you&#39;re familiar i.e.</p> <ol> <li><p>Change/add files</p> <li><p>Run <code>git status</code>, <code>git diff</code> to see what&#39;s changed</p> <li><p>Use <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code> to commit the changes</p> </ol> <li><p>Do you understand what <code>git diff --cached</code> does? &#40;do you understand the difference between the commit, the staging area, and the working tree&#41;? Look it up in the linked resources or ask someone...</p> <li><p>Once you have a few commits use <code>git log</code> to to view them.</p> <li><p>Now try running <code>git blame</code> on one of your files.</p> <li><p>Create an online repo using a git hosting service &#40;You can use bitbucket to make both private accounts and private repositories&#41;</p> <li><p>Link your local git repository with the hosting service &#40;by pushing in all the changes - the service should provide instructions for this&#41;.</p> <li><p>Use <code>git clone</code> to create a separate local repo in a different location from the one you were originally using.</p> <li><p>Commit changes in one of your local repos, push them to the server and then pull them to the other local repo.</p> <li><p>What happens if you try to push commits from repo A before pulling commits pushed by repo B?</p> </ol> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Oscar Benjamin.
