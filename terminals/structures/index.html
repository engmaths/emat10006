I only want to add a few things here. As usual there are <a href="#exercises">exercises</a> at the bottom of the page.</p> <h2 id=lists_tuples_sets_and_dicts ><a href="#lists_tuples_sets_and_dicts" class=header-anchor >Lists, tuples, sets and dicts</a></h2> <p>Python has two basic types that take the role that an &quot;array&quot; would have in some other languages &#40;e.g. C and Java&#41;. These are called <code>list</code> and <code>tuple</code>. Lists are <em>mutable</em> which means they can be modified. You can insert/remove/append items of a <code>list</code>. You can also set items of a list with the item-setting syntax <code>mylist&#91;index&#93; &#61; newvalue</code>. The size of a list can change.</p> <p>Tuples are <em>immutable</em> which means you cannot do modify them. You can still get items with <code>mytuple&#91;index&#93;</code> but you can&#39;t <em>set</em> them. This is mainly useful since immutability leads to <em>hashability</em>. The property of being hashable means that tuples &#40;unlike lists&#41; can be used as keys in other data structures such as sets and dicts.</p> <p>A <code>set</code> is an unordered collection of unique items, much like the mathematical concept of a set. We can loop over a set but the items come in an undefined order. A <code>dict</code> is like a set except that each element of the set is a <em>key</em> which is associated with a corresponding <em>value</em>.</p> <p>Here are some examples:</p> <pre><code class="python hljs"><span class=hljs-comment ># A list uses square brackets</span>
mylist = [<span class=hljs-number >2</span>, <span class=hljs-number >3</span>, <span class=hljs-number >4</span>, <span class=hljs-number >1</span>]

<span class=hljs-comment ># A tuple uses round brackets (or no brackets)</span>
mytuple = (<span class=hljs-number >2</span>, <span class=hljs-number >3</span>, <span class=hljs-number >4</span>, <span class=hljs-number >1</span>)

<span class=hljs-comment ># A set:uses curly brackets</span>
myset = {<span class=hljs-number >2</span>, <span class=hljs-number >3</span>, <span class=hljs-number >4</span>, <span class=hljs-number >1</span>} <span class=hljs-comment ># same as {1, 2, 3, 4} or set(range(1, 5))</span>

<span class=hljs-comment ># A dict uses curly brackets and colon separated key:value pairs</span>
mydict = {<span class=hljs-string >&#x27;Tom&#x27;</span>:<span class=hljs-number >50</span>, <span class=hljs-string >&#x27;Dick&#x27;</span>:<span class=hljs-number >60</span>, <span class=hljs-string >&#x27;Harry&#x27;</span>: <span class=hljs-number >0</span>}</code></pre> <h2 id=performance ><a href="#performance" class=header-anchor >Performance</a></h2> <p>These data structures can often be used in the same ways but have very different performance characteristics. For example with a list, it is efficient to add/remove items &#40;changing the size of the list&#41; only at the end of a large list. Removing an item at the beginning of a list is inefficient. However sets are efficient at adding/removing any item.</p> <p>Also we can ask whether <code>x in d</code> for any od these data structures <code>d</code>. This is called containment testing; we test of <code>d</code> contains <code>x</code>. For large lists or tuples this can be very inefficient as it involves looping through every item. For sets or dicts this is efficient no matter how big the data structure is.</p> <p>There are many other possible performance characteristics. You can see a description of the performance characteristics <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity">here</a>.</p> <h2 id=exercises ><a href="#exercises" class=header-anchor >Exercises</a></h2> <ol> <li><p>Given two lists how do we construct a dict with keys from one and values from the other? E.g. if I have <code>&#91;1, 2, 3&#93;</code> and <code>&#91;4, 5, 6&#93;</code> then I want <code>&#123;1:4, 2:5, 3:6&#125;</code>.</p> <li><p>Make a function that turns a dict of lists into a list of dicts. E.g if I have <code>&#123;&#39;a&#39;:&#91;1, 2&#93;, &#39;b&#39;:&#91;3, 4&#93;&#125;</code> then I want <code>&#91;&#123;&#39;a&#39;:1, &#39;b&#39;:3&#125;, &#123;&#39;a&#39;:2, &#39;b&#39;:4&#125;&#93;</code>.</p> <li><p>Given matrices in the form of lists of lists e.g. <code>&#91;&#91;1, 2, 3&#93;, &#91;4, 5, 6&#93;, &#91;7, 8, 9&#93;&#93;</code> write a function that can multiply two matrices &#40;returning a new matrix&#41;.</p> <li><p>Test the performance of different operations with different types of data structures. You can make e.g. a large set with <code>set&#40;range&#40;N&#41;&#41;</code> for large <code>N</code> and you may need to test these operations in a loop to ensure that the time difference becomes measurable.</p> <li><p>For <em>really</em> large data structures can you see how much memory python is using? How much memory does your computer have?</p> </ol> <h2 id=finished ><a href="#finished" class=header-anchor >Finished?</a></h2> <p>If you&#39;re happy with these you can move on to <a href="../fileio/">input/output</a>.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Oscar Benjamin.
